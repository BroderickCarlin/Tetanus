# Tetanus

Tetanus is the working name for a project aiming to create a receiver for small robotics applications, 
heavily inspired by the [Malenki Nano](https://github.com/MarkR42/malenki-nano)

Currently, Tetanus is based around a STM32F411RETx however the desire is to move to an NRF52 based
solution to enable BLE connectivity for the purpose of configuration and diagnostics
